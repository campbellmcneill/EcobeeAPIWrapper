# EcobeeAPIWrapper
A Java wrapper for the Ecobee REST/JSON service

This API wrapper was written for use within MullionWatcher (https://github.com/watsonta/MullionWatcher).

It is not complete, but serves as a good starting point for anyone wanting to interact with an
Ecobee thermostat. If you'd like to contribute to this project, please feel free to submit
pull requests.
